This is a copy of the old MIT Compilers tape. It's available on bitsavers.

It has been modified by me to compile. So far, only a86 builds, and that's
with a boatload of warnings turned off. If fails to work for reasons that
are not obvious. Nothing else has been changed yet. The 16032 and 68000
stuff likely will never be converted.

This code originally ran in BSD 4.1 VAXen, which is a different world
than today's 64-bit intel or arm platforms that are common. Expect there
to be a number of systemic changes to get types right, provide prototypes, etc.

A goal also, however, is to compile in the Venix/86 environment I've
been playing with...
