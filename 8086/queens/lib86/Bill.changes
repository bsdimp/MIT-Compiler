		Changes by Bill O'Farrell

All I did, other than re-compiling, was to change userio.c in the
subdirectory sys to put CR LF to the screen when it sees an LF.
An idea for future use, to use with my loader, is to change crt1.b86
to not have "?" as argv[0], but to have the invocation name, which
is now in the unformatted parameter string.
