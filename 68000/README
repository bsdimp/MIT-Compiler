This subtree contains versions of the 68000 C software from several
sources:

  mit	The original software as developed and maintained at MIT

  sun	Versions for the S.U.N. terminal project at Stanford

  hp	Versions for the Chipmonk at HP/Fort Collins

Someday, I'll merge the different versions to produce a "master" copy.
