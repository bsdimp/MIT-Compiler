Donn:
	I am told by tw that Gosling's EMACS does not run on a 9826 under
UNIX.  Is there anyone there that has looked at this problem?  I am not
really too keen on porting it myself, and so one of the possibilities
that I was considering was going to an outside source, such as asking
Gosling or people at MIT-LCS.  I would think that I would have to tell
them something about the machine that I am looking at.  Can I do this?
That is, is the 26 running UNIX proprietary?  Thanks in advance
for any information you can supply.
