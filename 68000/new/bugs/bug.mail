Using the .rept statement causes a segmentation fault.

Generated labels with `?' don't stay consistant within a macro.

Using the `\' feature doesn't include an evaluated expression (like
the Macro-11 manual says) -- it does something random.

I know I'm not using "advertised" features of the assembler -- I'm
using the Macro-11 assembler manual as a guide (the as68 documentation
says that it is "patterned" after Macro-11); there is indeed code in
as68 to do these things (or something like them!).

Is there better documentation for what commands as68 works correctly
on (that is, other than the nroff guide supplied with the sources)?

Is there anyone with bug fixes for the things mentioned above?

Does anyone know how to get in touch with Mike Patrick and J Gula
(their names, along with Chris Terman's are on the sources)?
