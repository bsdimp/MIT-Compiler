When you compiled Emacs with c68 which did you change to deal with the
language problems?  The ones I encountered were:

Identifier length (one identifier was longer than 20, which caused grief
somewhere).
(x == y) == z generates a warning when x,y are enums and z is int.
Enums can't be used in fields.
A mov instead of a movl was generated when exporting a struct.

I fixed the latter two.

John Seamons changed Emacs for the above.  There were also some problems to do
with array indexing invoking lmul instead of generating inline multiplies,
thus slowing redisplay down considerably, and floating point constants coming
out with 16-bit words inverted.

In the assembler there is a problem with stop not taking an argument.

It would be nice if we could bring our respective versions back into
agreement.  I'd like to be able to view MIT as the authority as to what c68
is, and to be able to get the latest MIT version of c68, o68, and a68.  Our
present version dates back to last December, and we have made quite a few bug
fixes to it since then, hopefully most of which have gone back to you.

Did you get my mail of November 6 with the following .a68 program?

	.text
.L:
	.data
	.word 0
	.text
	bra	.L
	.data

The version of o68 we have gets confused by this and manages to lose part of
the data segment.
