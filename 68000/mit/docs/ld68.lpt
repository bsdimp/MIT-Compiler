 _L_d_6_8 combines several object programs into one, resolves external references,
 and  searches libraries.  The object module produced by _l_d_6_8 may be executed,
 or used as input for another _l_d_6_8 run if the relocation  commands  have  been
 preserved  by  the  _-_r option.  The output from  _l_d_6_8 is left, by default, in
 _b_._o_u_t, which is made executable only if no errors occur during the load.

 _L_d_6_8 concatenates the  argument  routines  in  the  order  specified  by  the
 programer.  The entry point of _b_._o_u_t is the beginning of the first routine.

 Libraries  may  be specified as arguments.  _L_d_6_8 searches the library when it
 is encountered in the argument list, loading only those routines which define
 an unresolved external reference.  Since libraries  are  searched  once,  the
 order  of  routines  in  a library is important when more than one routine is
 referenced.  If a routine from a library references a  routine  in  the  same
 library,  the  referencing routine must preceed the referenced routine in the
 library.

 The options for _l_d_6_8 are listed below:

 _-_x discards local symbols, preserving only external  symbols  in  the  output
    symbol table.
 _-_X discards  all local symbols beginning with ".L".  This option is used with
    cc68 to discard internally  generated  labels  while  preserving  external
    symbols.
 _-_s discards all symbols and relocation commands to save space.
 _S  discards all symbols except locals and globals.
 _-_r generates relocation commands in _b_._o_u_t so that it may be used as input for
    another  _l_d_6_8  run.    _-_r  also  prevents  the  final definition of common
    symbols.
 _-_d defines common symbols even if the _-_r option is specified.
 _-_n creates a 410 file.
